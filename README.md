Hi Anyone!

I'm a student in my final year at university and I find myself in isolation from the rest of the world because of the Covid-19 lockdown. I am preparing the thesis for my diploma, and I could really use more determination to finish it. Also, I am really excited about Dune 2020 coming out, I really hope I get to see it in a cool cinema, in Germany, because that's where I want to go after graduation. I want one year off from school, before I enter a Master's program at university, to figure out what I want to do next and also to focus on my other many abilities that I kind of ignored until now. I want to read a lot of many more books for the time to come.
